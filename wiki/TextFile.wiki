= Implementation =
The TextFile class is a wrapper class that contains an arraylist of strings. The class has methods that allow users of objects made from the class to manipulate the arraylist of strings as though it were a text file. [sFile], [p1File], [p2File] and [lFile] are all passed around the program as TextFile objects.

== Variables ==


== Methods ==
===input(String)===
input(text) - Adds a String of text to the last line of the text file.

===String getLine()===
text getLine() - Returns a String of text that represents the current line of the text file from the pointer's current position to the end and increments the pointer to the next line. This call can be mixed with getToken(), but if a getToken() call was made earlier getLine() will only return what is left on the current line.

Use the isEndOfFile() to ensure that you are not at the end of file before calling this method. DO NOT CALL THIS METHOD IF isEndOfFile() returns true.

Pointer position line 0, spot 6

4 strings inside of TextFile

"Hello, this is manuel."

"I'm watching Burn Notice"

""

"It's a really great show"

getLine() returns " this is manuel."

Pointer is now line 1, spot 0

getLine() returns "I'm watching Burn Notice"

Pointer is now line 2, spot 0

getLine() returns ""

Pointer is now line 3, spot 0



===String getToken()===
text getToken() - Returns a String of text that represents the next non-white space token. Then it increments the pointer to the end of that text. If it's at the end of the string, it returns "" and increments to the next line.

Tokens come in five varities
 * Quotation Tokens
   * Any string encapsulated within quotation marks. It will include the quotation marks with the string. *{{{"hi! "}}}* is an example of a quotation token. Be careful with this type of token, *{{{"hi!  ;print "}}}* is an example of a quotation token that is well formed, by syntactically incorrect. The writer of the source code meant to close off the original " but did not.
 * Malformed Quotation Tokens
   * Any string with a leading " that is not terminated by a following quotation mark somewhere else on the line. Whomever is handling this token should emit an error if they get a token with a leading " with no ending ". Examples:
     * "hi!       ;print hi!
 * Alphanumeric Tokens
   * Any string without a leading " or ;. Examples:
     * HALT
     * ACC,count
     * R0,R0,x0
 * Comment Tokens
   * Any string with a leading ;. Examples:
     * ;print "hi! "
     * ; Example Program
     * ;M[Array] <- xFFFF
 * End of Line Tokens
   * An empty string. Should be used to check to see if you've gotten out the last token.

Use the isEndOfFile() to ensure that you are not at the end of file before calling this method. DO NOT CALL THIS METHOD IF isEndOfFile() returns true.

===TextFile(string)===
TextFile(name) - Takes in a file called "name" as input and converts it into the TextFile format.

===write(String)===
write(name) - Outputs the TextFile to a file called "name".

===display()===
display() - Outputs the TextFile to the screen.

===reset()===
reset() - Returns the pointer to line 0, spot 0

===boolean isEndOfFile()===
end isEndOfFile() - Returns end which is true if the pointer for the TextFile object is pointing at the end of file, or if the textfile object is completely empty.
