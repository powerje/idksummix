= Introduction =

For this lab we are writing an assembler for our abstract machine.

= Flow Charts =
  * [Lab2Flow]

= Classes =
  * [Pass1]
  * [Pass2]
  * [MachineOpTable]
  * [PseudoOpTable]
  * [SymbolTable]
  * [LocationCounter]
  * [LiteralTable]
  * [Assembler]
  * [TextFile]

= Files =
  * [sFile sFile - Source File]
  * [p1File p1File - Transitional File]
  * [p2File p2File - Object File]
  * [lFile lFile - Listing File]

= How to run in Unix =

the .class files need to be in a directory called summixSimulator<br>
which is the same name as our package files<br>
then you type<br>
{{{java-Xms126m -Xmx256m summixSimulator/Simulator}}}
